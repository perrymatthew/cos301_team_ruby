	Used programming languages:
		Java
Apple IOS:

		CSS
		Javascript
	Used protocols:
		HTTP
		UDP

For all:
	Used libraries:
		Google Maps API: to interact with GIS system.


(// Google Maps as technology is omitted because it is only interacted with through the access channel and not part of the access channel therfore not in scope?)
(// Discuss whether we should perhaps use a multiOS framework for dev)
