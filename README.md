# cos301_team_ruby
This is the GitHub repository for Team Ruby for round 2 of the COS301 class project

Workflow conventions:

Pull and compile before you push

In the projects tab, move work you want to work on from the TODO column into the In Progress column and assign yourself to the issue.

When complete, move your work from In Progress to the Review column to be reviewed and given feedback by a peer. After review, the peer will move the work to Done and close the issue.
